# Design Pattern
Design Pattern is a general reuseable solutions to the problems which are commonly occurring in time of software Design.

Gang Of Four peoples design those Design Pattern under the two main principles.

## Principles of Design Pattern
  
  * Favor object composition over inheritance.
  * Code for interface not for implementation

## Types of Design Patterns

  1) [Creational Patterns](https://github.com/DhanabalShanmugam/Design-Pattern/tree/master/Creational%20Pattern) 
  2) [Structural Patterns](https://github.com/DhanabalShanmugam/Design-Pattern/tree/master/Structural%20Patterns)
  3) Behavioral Patterns
  
Under these three we have 23 Design Patterns.

### Creational Patterns
  
 Creational Design Pattern Deals with the Object creation. It helps to solve problems in object creations in different situations.
 
 #### Types of Creational Patterns
 
 1) [Singleton  Pattern](https://github.com/DhanabalShanmugam/Design-Pattern/tree/master/Creational%20Pattern/Singleton%20Pattern)
 2) [Factory Pattern](https://github.com/DhanabalShanmugam/Design-Pattern/tree/master/Creational%20Pattern/Factory%20Pattern)
 3) [Abstract Factory Pattern](https://github.com/DhanabalShanmugam/Design-Pattern/tree/master/Creational%20Pattern/Abstract%20Factory%20Pattern)
 4) [Builder Pattern](https://github.com/DhanabalShanmugam/Design-Pattern/tree/master/Creational%20Pattern/Builder%20Pattern)
 5) [Prototype Pattern](https://github.com/DhanabalShanmugam/Design-Pattern/tree/master/Creational%20Pattern/Prototype%20Pattern)

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

#### Types of Structural Patterns

1) [Adapter Pattern](https://github.com/DhanabalShanmugam/Design-Pattern/tree/master/Structural%20Patterns/Adapter%20Pattern)
2) [Bridge Pattern](https://github.com/DhanabalShanmugam/Design-Pattern/tree/master/Structural%20Patterns/Bridge%20Pattern)
3) Composite Pattern
4) [Decorator Pattern](https://github.com/DhanabalShanmugam/Design-Pattern/tree/master/Structural%20Patterns/Decorator%20Pattern)
5) Facade Pattern
6) Flyweight Pattern
7) proxy Pattern

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

#### Types of Behavioral Patterns

1)  Chain of Responsibility Pattern
2)  Command Pattern
3)  Interpreter Pattern
4)  Iterator Pattern
5)  Mediator Pattern
6)  Memento Pattern
7)  Observer Pattern
8)  State Pattern
9)  Strategy Pattern
10) Template Pattern
11) Visitor Pattern
